# Top 10 List of Week 07

1. [Synchronization in OS](https://www.guru99.com/process-synchronization.html)<br>
In Operating Systems, there are 2 types of processes: Independent Process and Cooperative Process. Independent Process means that when a process is executed, it won't affect the execution of other processes. The opposite applies for Cooperative Process. Process synchronization problem arises in the case of Cooperative process also because resources are shared in Cooperative processes. This article explains how the Synchronization works. it also explains about the Critical Section Problem, which plays the main role in Process Synchronization.

2. [Critical Section Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMQsd7Iy5jo)<br>
When more than one processes access a same code segment that segment is known as critical section. Critical section contains shared variables or resources which are needed to be synchronized to maintain consistency of data variable. Although the previous point explains a bit about Critical Section Problem, this video gives a deeper insight into the Critical Section Problem.

3. [Shared Memory](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/inter_process_communication/inter_process_communication_shared_memory.htm)<br>
Shared memory is memory that may be simultaneously accessed by multiple programs with an intent to provide communication among them or avoid redundant copies. Shared memory is an efficient means of passing data between programs. This page explains Shared Memory perfectly, as it not only provides diagrams, it also provides some source code to understand how it would work in an actual program.

4. [Consistency Model](https://shashankbaravani.medium.com/consistency-models-in-distributed-systems-d64c134f84ce)<br>
The Consistency Model is an important concept in programming, especially in distributed systems like shared memory systems or data stores such as filesystems, databases, or web caching. However, it's not an easy concept to understand, especially with how vague it is. The article provides some diagrams and examples to make it easier to understand. The article also uses simple languages to make it even easier to understand.

5. [Message Passing in OS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuuSXWkDJOo)<br>
Message passing model allows multiple processes to read and write data to the message queue without being connected to each other. Messages are stored on the queue until their recipient retrieves them. Message queues are quite useful for interprocess communication and are used by most operating systems. The reason why this model is popular, is because it is much easier to implement compared to the Shared Memory Model, and Message Passing Model is also tolerant of higher communication latencies. However, connection setup takes time, therefore it has slower communication than the Shared Memory Model. [The second part of the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3mS8MR7bUY) talks more about linking processes in Message Passing Systems.

6. [Deadlock](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-deadlock-in-operating-system/)<br>
Deadlock is a situation that occurs in OS when any process enters a waiting state because another waiting process is holding the demanded resource. Deadlock is a common problem in multi-processing where several processes share a specific type of mutually exclusive resource known as a soft lock or software. Examples of it would be a traffic jam in an intersection that is going in one direction. GeeksForGeeks provide useful diagrams to help explain it, and some exercises to make sure you understand enough about Deadlock.

7. [Starvation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/starvation-and-aging-in-operating-systems/)<br>
Starvation or indefinite blocking is phenomenon associated with the Priority scheduling algorithms, in which a process ready to run for CPU can wait indefinitely because of low priority. In heavily loaded computer system, a steady stream of higher-priority processes can prevent a low-priority process from ever getting the CPU. It is similar in concept to Deadlock, with both causing processes to halt. As always, the article provides diagrams and some solutions to Starvation to help explain it.

8. [Deadlock vs Starvation](https://techdifferences.com/difference-between-deadlock-and-starvation-in-os.html)<br>
Although they are similar in that the processes are blocked/halted, there are some significant differences between the two. In Deadlock, all the processes keep waiting for the other to complete, the resources are blocked by processes, can be prevented by avoiding the conditions, and also called Circular Wait. Starvation happens when high priority processes keep executing and low priority processes are blocked, resources are continuously utilized by high priority processes, can be prevented by Aging, and also known as Lived Lock. The article explains their differences in extensive details.

9. [Semaphores in OS](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/semaphores-in-operating-system)<br>
Semaphores are mostly known as the flags used to send coded messages, usually used by sailors to send messages to other ships, usually to signify dangers. However, it's also used in computing processes. Counting semaphores are a synchronization mechanism commonly used to serialize or coordinate multiple threads of control. Counting semaphores are typically used for counting events and resource management. The article explains the types and advantages/disadvantages of Semaphore in compact.

10. [Semaphore in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukM_zzrIeXs)<br>
In my opinion, although this video is 13 minutes long, it explains everything about Semaphore in pretty great detail. It also provides some examples in C.

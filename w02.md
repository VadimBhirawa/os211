# Top 10 List of Week 02

1. [Security In Operating Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKkOBClw1Q)<br>
This video helped me understand more on Security in Operating Systems, and why it is needed. In general, there are two main aspects in Security: Authentication and Authorization. Authentication deals with verifying the identity of the user using the device, while Authorization verifies the user's right to access it. Also, there are four main levels of security measures: Physical, Human, Network, and OS.

2. [Protection in Operating Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_WbprDZMDw)<br>
By the same lecturer as the previous video, this video talks about protection involving two entities: Objects and Domain. Objects involve hardware and software objects. Domain specifically is a collection of access rights. The table that the lecturer explains around the 2:45 timestamp is the Access Matrix. It is a security model that defines the rights of each process based on the specific Domain and Object.

3. [Security Threats](https://www.guru99.com/potential-security-threats-to-your-computer-systems.html)<br>
This article explains every potential threats that can be found in computer systems. Physical Threats are threats that might cause physical damage to the system or make it irreparable. It can be caused by Internal Threats (Directly causing damage from inside like system parts, etc), External Threats (Causing damage from outside like natural disasters), and Human Threats (Done by thieves, or careless people). Non-Physical Threats are threats that may endanger computer systems in the form of viruses, trojans, worms, spyware, etc.

4. [Social Engineering](https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/tips-articles/what-is-social-engineering)<br>
Social Engineers are basically criminals who trick people into giving personal, usually confidential, data. This act of deception is commonly known as "Social Engineering". What's dangerous about Social Engineers, is the fact that they can disguise themselves as a trusted source. Be it your own colleagues or trusted email addresses, Social Engineers can imitate their behaviors and pique your interest into clicking malicious links or giving away information if you're not careful. This such attack is an example of "Phishing", one of the most famous example of a Social Engineering attack. The article above explains Social Engineering with enough detail and also provide ways to protect yourself from attacks.

5. [Malware](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3295877/what-is-malware-viruses-worms-trojans-and-beyond.html)<br>
Malware includes any type of software that has the potential to cause harm to computer users, as it is short for "malicious software". Hackers use it to incite destruction and steal confidential information from the general user. There are many ways to split the types of Malware. The most used generalization splits Malware into three types based on how they infect their targets: Worms (reproduces and spreads from one computer to another), Viruses (piece of code that inserts into the code of another program and forces it to commit malicious deeds), and Trojans (it can't reproduce, but disguises itself as something the average user would use). The other way to split it is by basing it on what it does once it infects their target. When categorized that way, there are six types: Spyware (secretly gathering data), Rootkit (give hackers remote access), Adware (forces victims' browser to redirect to advertisements), Ransomware (encrypts hard disks full of important files and demand payment to decrypt it), Cryptojacking (using victims' CPU to mine crypto currencies), and Malvertising (usage of legal advertisements to send malware to victims unbeknownst to them).

6. [DoS Attack](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-a-denial-of-service-attack-dos)<br>
Denial-of-Service Attack, like their name, is intended to deny victims of computer services, basically making their computer systems unusable. Unlike most attacks that target the victims' important files or money, a DoS attack is usually done to mess with the victim, as it wastes their time and/or money to handle. The hacker themselves don't really get anything from the victims except their pain and suffering. A DoS attack is usually done by flooding the services used by targets, and triggering a crash. A more dangerous type of DoS attack is called "DDoS" (Distributed Denial of Service). It's more dangerous because multiple systems are designed by the hacker to cause DoS attacks on one specific target.

7. [Not Even A Multi-Million Company Is Save From Ransomware](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55994787)<br>
This is an interesting article about a Multi-Million Game Company that has recently been hit by a Ransomware Attack. This is a pretty famous Game Company called "CD Projekt Red" that has created popular games such as The Witcher series and Cyberpunk 2077. In this case, the hackers accessed the internal network of the company, scrambling the data servers, and blackmailed them by taking its important data hostage. This shows that even a secure network of multi-million companies can get attacked by Ransomware at any time. [This link](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-11-steps-you-should-take-to-protect-against-disaster/) could provide ways to protect oneself from Ransomware.

8. [Cryptography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yFZGF8FHSg)<br>
This video explains what Cryptography is and how to decrypt/encrypt codes in the most basic way possible. To encrypt information, a Cipher and a Key is needed. The Cipher is the rules to encrypt it, while the Key tells how to arrange the Cipher. One way to decrypt an information is by Brute-Force, basically changing each and every letter of an encrypted information until it forms a coherent sentence. One of the earliest Cipher is called the Vigenere Cypher, where the key is a word, and the information is encrypted by using a Vigenere Square where the alphabet is lined up on the row and column and shifted by one on the next rows. The hardest encryption method to decode is called a "One Time Pad" encryption, where the Key is as long as the message itself, making sure no pattern can be found in the encrypted information.

9. [Access Control List](https://www.imperva.com/learn/data-security/access-control-list-acl/)<br>
Access Control List or ACL are rules that could provide or deny access to virtual/digital environments. In general, there are two types: Filesystem ACLs and Networking ACLs. ACLs are recommended to be used because it can control traffic flow, increase network performance by forbidding/restricting certain network traffic, some levels of network access security, and monitor traffic access of the system.


10. [Tips To Protect Yourself On The Internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ni_PWxrsNo)<br>
This video reveals five easy ways to protect yourself in this digital age, presented by a former hacker. Using 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) is recommended, as it requires at least two devices to get access to your account. Second, it's obvious that using the same password on every website is frowned upon. Third, all the softwares on your device should be updated, as hackers wouldn't be able to use known obsolete methods to hack your account. Don't post too much information online, as hackers could use your social media information to initiate attacks. Last is don't share information that are too personal, as hackers could use those informations to commit fraud or malicious deeds.

# Top 10 List of Week 01

<b>1. [Virtual Machine/VirtualBox](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-a-virtual-machine/)</b><br>
Virtual Machine by itself is the virtualization and/or emulation of a computer's operating system. An easier way to explain it, is that with a Virtual Machine, your computer can run 2 different operating system at the same time. Think of it as a body with 2 brains, one can be used for your usual behaviors, and the other one can be used to solve/think about more complex behaviors. I watched [this video](https://youtu.be/yIVXjl4SwVo) that is less than 3 minutes and it helped me understand a bit better on what a Virtual Machine is and why it is useful.

<b>2. [Virtual Machine Manager](http://techgenix.com/about-virtual-machine-manager/)</b><br>
A Virtual Machine Manager is a so called "hypervisor", is a software, firmware, or hardware virtualization technique that allows multiple operating systems to run concurrently on a host computer. It's called a "hypervisor" because in concept, it's one level higher than supervisory programs, a supervisor of supervisors. Using a VMM, multiple instances of a variety of operating systems can share a virtualized hardware resources. It's ideal for those who are interested in many different operating systems and want to try all of them, those who want to conduct testing in a closed environment, and those who want to create system-level backups.

<b>3. [Linux](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux/)</b><br>
Linux is an operating system, like Microsoft's Windows, and Apple's iOS and Mac OS. Linux is arguably one of the most popular open-sourced operating System because it has many usages, such as, automobile systems, supercomputers, even the most popular smartphone operating system, Android, is based on Linux Kernel. The perks of using it comes from the fact that it's easily customizable, and the fact that it's Open source. This means that you can use the operating system without cost, customize it to suit your needs, even redistribute the original copies and the copies that has been modified. It also has a low (or even zero) risk of ransomware, malware, or viruses.

<b>4. [Debian](https://www.debian.org/intro/about)</b><br>
Debian, also known as Debian GNU/Linux is an operating system based on Linux. It is widely renowned as the most stable and secure Linux based operating system. It also provides extensive hardware support, smooth upgrades, and basically the "seed" for other Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, PureOS, or SteamOS.

<b>5. [Basic Linux Commands](https://maker.pro/linux/tutorial/basic-linux-commands-for-beginners)</b><br>
There are many essential commands for Linux based operating systems. This is especially useful for Linux beginners because to get the most out of Linux, you would need to enter the command lines. Of course, those that are experienced in Windows' Command Prompt might remember lines such as "cd" to change directory, and "ls" to list directory contents. You can even use other commands such as "su -" to login as a root user if you aren't already, and "w" or "who" to see how many users there are in the system and who they are.

<b>6. [Virtualization](https://opensource.com/resources/virtualization)</b><br>
By definition, Virtualization is the act of creating a virtual version of something. In this case, it allows the creation of useful IT services using resources bound to a hardware. Now it is commonly used to run a virtual instance of one or multiple operating systems in one hardware. [This short video](https://youtu.be/FZR0rG3HKIk) helped me understand a bit more about Virtualization with easy to understand schemas and examples.

<b>7. [Virtualization vs Emulation?](https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/7952/whats-the-difference-between-virtualization-and-emulation-why-it-matters/)</b><br>
As we've learned before, Virtualization is done by creating a virtual version. What is the difference between Virtualization and Emulation then? By definition, Emulation is the act of enabling one computer system to "imitate" the behaviors of another computer system. This allows a modern computer system to imitate the behaviors of an old computer system, or even lets it imitate an old game console and play old timely games.

In essence, this makes Emulation run slower than Virtualization. An emulator will run the commands and inputs meant for the system it's imitating as, compared to virtual machines that use hardware optimized virtualization techniques. An emulator will force newer computer systems to "dumb down" to suit the target system, which is almost always years older than the host computer system.

<b>8. [Virtualization Pros](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/6014-pros-cons-virtualization.html)</b><br>
With Virtualization technologies, you may need fewer computer hardwares than usual. This could greatly reduce the hardware costs in businesses by a margin. If the servers are also virtualized, administration and management processes can be automated. Recovery and setup can be done easily, as there are many tools to help backup data in real-time. The link I provided here gives extensive advantages and disadvantages of Virtualization that is typically found in a business environment.

<b>9. [Virtualization Cons](https://www.hitechnectar.com/blogs/pros-cons-virtualization/)</b><br>
One major con of Virtualization, is the fact that the initial cost has a hefty price. While there are many operating systems that are open-source, servers, softwares, and tools aren't. So to set everything up could take a good portion of your budget. Also, not every application or tool support virtualization. Hence, scalability might be a problem if needed in a short time. Data is also not hosted locally, but from a third-party, and virtual machines share the same resources with each other and the host system. The link I provided lists the advantages and disadventages of using Virtualization for personal use, insted of a business environment.

<b>10. [Cloud Computing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-cloud-computing/)</b><br>
The simplest way to explain Cloud Computing is that it means storing and accessing data and programs that is hosted on the internet instead of it being hosted locally. One common example you might find is Google Cloud and Google Drive. You can open file that's hosted under your account or even someone else's file that's shared to you.

There are also many different Cloud Computing Services. SaaS (Software as a Service) provides the application services through the use of a browser, an example is Microsoft's Office 365. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) provides storage and computing infrastructures services through the internet, Amazon Web Services is the first IaaS provider. PaaS (Platform as a Service) offers workflows and services targetted at developers, providing shared tools, processess, and APIs. FaaS (Functions as a Service) offers a way for developers to completely insulate themselves from everything in the stack below their code.

# Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [Virtual Memory in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)<br>
To put it simply, Virtual Memory is a scheme to allocate storage. In the scheme, a secondary memory can be addressed as if it were part of the main memory. The memory addresses used by a program can be mapped into physical addresses inside the computer memory, hence it implements both hardware and software. The page linked above explains it in detail, and also offers explanation regarding Demand Paging, Advantages, Page Fault, etc.

2. [Virtual Address Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdRTrXnYP0c)<br>
In Operating Systems, Virtual Address Space (VAS) or address space is the set of ranges of virtual addresses that an operating system makes available to a process. The video above made an abstraction of VAS so it could be easily understood in a straightforward manner.

3. [Demand Paging](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-demand-paging)<br>
Demand Paging is basically a concept where all pages of frams are kept in the secondary memory until the moment they are required. Therefore, it won't load any pages in the main memory until they're specifically required. The concept came from a problem in Virtual Memory, where deciding which pages need to be kept in the main memory and which need to be kept in the secondary memory is difficult. The article explains Demand Paging in comprehensive details, I cannot recommend it enough.

4. [Page Fault](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgmws9oraXE)<br>
Page Fault happens when the referred page on paging isn't present inside the main memory. Hence, there would be a miss while referencing, other than Page Fault, it's also sometimes called Page Miss. The bigger problem happens when the number of page fault is high, as the CPU has to access the missed page from the secondary memory. The video explains the concept of Page Fault and how bad it could affect the performance time.

5. [Performance of Demand Paging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPcsNmpMP70)<br>
Demand Paging Performance is usually measured in terms of the effective access time. Effective access time should be equal to memory access time as long as there are no page faults. In some sense it is an average or expected access time. The video shows the performance of Demand Paging with easy-to-understand graphics.

6. [Copy on Write](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/copy-on-write/)<br>
Copy on Write (usually called as "COW") is an optimization strategy used in computer programming. The idea of the concept is that if multiple callers ask for resources which are initially indistinguishable, pointers can be given to the same resource. This function can be maintained until a caller tries to modify its "copy" of the resource, at which point a true private copy is created to prevent the changes becoming visible to everyone else. The common usage of COW is in maintenance of instant snapshot on database servers. Article provide helpful details about COW and even a graphic detailing the process.

7. [Page Replacement Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/)<br>
Paging on Virtual Memory needs an algorithm to decided which page to replace when a new page is referenced. In general, the most popular algorithms are First In First Out (FIFO), Optimal Page Replacement, and Least Recently Used. The details of each algorithm and their advantages are present in the article I linked.

8. [Caching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYIVyLkXSmM)<br>
A cache is a hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that specific data can be delivered faster. The content, which includes HTML pages, images, files and Web objects, is stored on the local hard drive in order to make it faster for the user to access it, which helps improve the efficiency of the computer and its overall performance. The video I linked provides an example of Server Caching, however other types of Caching works very similar to Server Caching.

9. [Thrashing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-Ke2OVZLQI)<br>
Thrashing occurs when a computer's virtual memory resources are overused, leading to a constant state of paging and page faults. This causes the performance of the computer to decrease, and could even cause it to collapse. The video also includes how Thrashing could happen, and how to prevent or limit the effects of it.

10. [NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access)](http://www.techplayon.com/what-is-numa-non-uniform-memory-access/)<br>
Non-Uniform Memory Access or NUMA, is a new architecture where each processor has a local bank of memory, to which it has a much closer (lower latency) access. Therefore, it allows a processor faster access to contents of memory than other traditional techniques. The article provides a brief yet helpful explanation of NUMA, and images to provide easier details, and the features of NUMA.

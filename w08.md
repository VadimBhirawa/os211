# Top 10 List of Week 08

1. [Process Scheduling in OS](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling.htm)<br>
The article above includes understandable diagrams and the processes of scheduling queues.

2. [Burst in OS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVzb3TUcDLo)<br>
There are CPU and I/O Burst Cycles in Operating Systems. In simple terms, it just means a brief stretch of CPU and I/O executing as fast as they can go. The 8 minute video explains almost everything about CPU and I/O Bursts.

3. [I/O Burst using Round Robin Algo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d8r3M_tVXw)<br>
There are many Burst Algorithms in OS. One of them being the RR or Round Robin. In Round Robin, time slices are assigned to each process in equal portions and in circular order, handling all processes without priority. This video shows the example of I/O Burst using that algorithm.

4. [Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-preemptive-priority-scheduling)<br>
Preemptive scheduling is used when a process switches from running state to ready state or from waiting state to ready state. The resources are allocated to the process for the limited amount of time and then is taken away, and the process is again placed back in the ready queue if that process still has CPU burst time remaining. That process stays in ready queue till it gets next chance to execute. The article explains this pretty well and adds examples on top of that. And even adds GANTT chart preparation.

5. [Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-non-preemptive-priority-scheduling)<br>
Non-preemptive Scheduling is used when a process terminates, or a process switches from running to waiting state. In this scheduling, once the resources is allocated to a process, the process holds the CPU till it gets terminated or it reaches a waiting state. In my opinion, this article explains it pretty well, and similar to the article before this, adds useful examples.

6. [Preemptive vs Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/preemptive-vs-non-preemptive-scheduling.html)<br>
Based on the two points before this, there are two scheduling methods in OS, Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling. I wondered what their differences are so I found this article that explains the pros and cons of both quite well.

7. [Process Contention Scope](http://what-when-how.com/Tutorial/Multithreaded-Programming-with-JAVA/Multithreaded-Programming-with-JAVA-00047.html)<br>
The contention takes place among threads within a same process. The thread library schedules the high-prioritized PCS thread to access the resources via available LWPs (priority as specified by the application developer during thread creation). Although the article lacks visuals, it explains PCS in a pretty easy way.

8. [System Contention Scope](http://what-when-how.com/Tutorial/Multithreaded-Programming-with-JAVA/Multithreaded-Programming-with-JAVA-00050.html)<br>
The contention takes place among all threads in the system. In this case, every SCS thread is associated to each LWP by the thread library and are scheduled by the system scheduler to access the kernel resources. The article provides diagrams to help explain SCS.

9. [Completely Fair Scheduler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scfDOof9pww)<br>
As the name suggest it fairly or equally divides the CPU time among all the processes.Before understanding the CFS lets look at Ideal Fair Scheduling (IFS) of N processes. If there are N processes in the ready queue then each process receives (100/N)% of CPU time according to IFS. Although the video is quite long, it explains the whole concept of CFS quite well.

10. [Multiple-Processor Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiple-processor-scheduling-in-operating-system/)<br>
Multiprocessor Scheduling is an optimization problem involving the scheduling of computational tasks in a multiprocessor environment. The article explains it all pretty well and comprehensively.

# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Addressing in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/)<br>
This page helps with understanding the addressing that is found in Operating Systems. Particularly, Logical and Physical Address. This page provides a schema on the differences between those two, and also a comparison chart to make it even easier and clearer. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmTMr_x3NwY) also make the difference even easier to be understood.

2. [Hardware Protection](https://www.includehelp.com/operating-systems/hardware-protection.aspx)<br>
Hardware Protection is generally divided to three different categories: CPU Protection, Memory Protection, and I/O Protection. This article explains the differences in a clear and concise manner. It also provides some examples.

3. [Address Binding](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-is-address-binding)<br>
Address Binding is the act of allocating a physical memory location to a logical pointer. This is done by associating a physical address to a logical address. Logical address is also known as virtual address. The link above provides useful information, such as Memory Management, Compile TIme, Load Time, and even Execution Time.

4. [Dynamic Linking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKmAJMe3t9E)<br>
Dynamic Linking works by loading and linking shared libraries needed by an executable when executed at run time. This is done by copying the library contents from a persistent storage to RAM, filling jump tables and relocating pointers. The video above provide wonderful explanations regarding Dynamic Linking and showing the examples of what happens on the linking.

5. [Static Linking](https://docs.windriver.com/bundle/Wind_River_Linux_Platform_Developers_Guide_8.0_1/page/uzw1550188324056.html)<br>
Static Linking works by including all the library files needed by a package or application into one single executable module. The docs provide some useful information regarding Static Linking.

6. [Static vs Dynamic Linking](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-and-dynamic-linking-in-operating-systems/)<br>
In general, Static and Dynamic Linking both work by loading/linking libraries needed for an executable program or application. This article provide the disadvantages of both and point out the differences between them.

7. [Memory Manager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdkxXygc3rE)<br>
A Memory Manager is a software part of kernel for managing Memory Management Units (MMU). Memory Management needs to be done to provide ways to nynamically allocate portions of memory to programs at their requests, freeing it when it's no longer needed so it can be reused. This video provide useful explanations, and the narrator explains it in a soothing voice and uses easy words to make sure anyone can understand the concept.

8. [Paging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ypa8Uwf5YA)<br>
In Operating Systems, Paging is a memory management scheme that functions to eliminate the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory. By using this scheme, the physical address space of a process can be permitted to be non-contiguous. The video also includes explanations regarding logical addressing, translation lookaside buffer, and page-to-frame translation.

9. [Page Table](https://www.gatevidyalay.com/page-table-paging-in-operating-system/)<br>
Page Table is basically a data structure. This data structure functions to store the mapping between logical addresses and physical addresses. It is commonly used by the virtual memory system. Logical addresses are generated by the CPU for the pages of the processes therefore they are generally used by the processes. Physical addresses are the actual frame address of the memory. They are generally used by the hardware or more specifically by RAM subsystems.

10. [Little and Big Endian](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/little-and-big-endian-mystery/)<br>
Little and Big Endians are ways to store multiple address variables (byte size of more than 1, such as int, float). The difference is, in Little Endian, the last byte of binary representation of the multibyte variable is stored first. Vice versa, on Big Endian, the first byte of binary representation of the multibyte variable is stored first. The page also provides some sample codes in C and C++.

# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [File System in Computing](https://www.howtogeek.com/196051/htg-explains-what-is-a-file-system-and-why-are-there-so-many-of-them/)<br>
Even in a traditional sense, "File System" means the way we organize and store files, be it paper, documents, or what not. In computers, there is a file system that is used to organize and store files in storage devices such as hard drive, flash drive, etc. Also, computers need to recognize a file system to be able to display its contents and open it. There are different file systems, and they all have their unique way in how they organize and store data. The most commonly used systems on Windows are NTFS (New Technology File System), and FAT32 (File Allocation Table 32).

2. [Directory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYPYPDiGNcA)<br>
Back in the age of MS-DOS, there weren't any "windows" to switch folders. Instead they used "dir" or "directory" to see all the files inside a computer and open them. It is served in a hierarchical fashion to keep things organized.

3. [File Access Method](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-file-access-methods)<br>
In general, there are three methods to access files: Sequential Access, Direct Access, and Indexed Access.
In Sequential Access, the files that are accessed are read word by word. In other words, it's accessed sequentially.
Direct Access is usually used on database systems, because sometimes some information are required to be filtered. It is mostly slower in some cases compared to the other two.
In Indexed Access, a file that is accessed can be assigned an index to mark the address of a record in the file.

4. [Types of File Systems](https://www.reclaime.com/library/filesystem-types.aspx)<br>
The link I provided explains more on all the different file system types and a chart of distribution in data recovery incidents. In general, the most common system on Windows is NTFS, the newest one in Apple devices is APFS (Apple File System), and on Linux, the most used is the ext system and its generations (ext2, ext3, and ext4).

5. [Partitioning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeUM4kR67XQ)<br>
Basically, partitioning in file system means that one physical hard drive or storage device you use is split and the OS treats them as two different storage devices. It's usually used to split Operating System, drivers, and pre-installed programs, or when the user wants to dual-boot different OS.

6. [Virtual File System (VFS)](https://opensource.com/article/19/3/virtual-filesystems-linux)<br>
On Linux, there's something called Virtual File System, which is Linux's default file system implementation. VFS is basically an abstract layer that gives applications access to different types of file systems and local/network storage devices.

7. [File System Implementation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-system-implementation-in-operating-system/)<br>
File system dictates how efficient and convenient access to the disk by allowing data to be modified is done. Its advantage is that duplication of codes can be minimized, and each file system have its own logical file system, while the disadvantage comes from decrease of performance when too many files are accessed at the same time. File system can be implemented by using two types of data structures: On-disk Structures, and In-Memory Structure.

8. [Mounting/Unmounting](https://medium.com/@riteeksrivastava/mounting-in-file-system-c965c907a40b)<br>
Before files on a specific file system can be accessed, the file system needs to be mounted first. By mounting a file system, it is attached to a directory called "mount point" and makes it so that is available to the system. Unmounting removes the ability to access those files.

9. [Journaling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey0BEqCEkM)<br>
Journaling File System keeps track of changes to the file system that hasn't been saved/comitted yet. Therefore, if there ever is any sudden shutdowns, or crashes, the latest version of the files can be accessed, decreasing the possibility of it corrupting.

10. [Log-Structured File System (LFS)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/log-structured-file-system-lfs/)<br>
Log-Structured File System is a file system that is focused on write performance, and works efficiently on disk writes and also metadata updates. The way it works is, this file system keeps a small buffer of all writes in a specific memory segment. The log is a data structure written at the head, once it's full, it's written into an unused part of the disk sequentially.

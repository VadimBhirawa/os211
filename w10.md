# Top 10 List of Week 10

1. [OS Main Page](https://os.vlsm.org/)<br>
This is the mainpage of the OS course. This website contains a lot of learning materials, such as slides, youtube playlists, even a book.

2. [Lecturer's Website](https://osp4diss.vlsm.org/)<br>
The lecturer's website contains everything you would need to build your own OS on Debian. If you follow everything correctly, it should be fine. If something breaks or went wrong, GSGS (Google sana, Google sini) also helps a bunch.

3. [Fun VM Content Creator](https://www.youtube.com/user/SomeOrdinaryGamers)<br>
If you're ever stressed out about this course and need a break/downtime but still want to watch things about Virtual Machines, one of my favorite youtube content creator is a Virtual Machine freak. He occasionally makes videos about Virtual Machine, such as [this video tutorial](https://youtu.be/BNLnTCqUMyY), and [this video where he talks about Virtual Machines and which OS to use it one](https://youtu.be/9JWkNLSeBCE).

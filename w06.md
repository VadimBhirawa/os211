# Top 10 List of Week 06

1. [Concurrency](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/concurrency-in-operating-system/)<br>
By definition, Concurrency is doing multiple tasks at the same time. Therefore, Concurrency in Operating Systems is very similar to that. In Operating Systems, Concurrency is the execution of multiple instances at the same time. In the OS, several process threads are running in parallel. In my opinion, GeeksforGeeks is a very good website to learn everything about computers, hence why I use their web often times. They always provide easy explanation and enough examples to explain the concepts.

2. [Concurrency vs Parallelism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltTQaMSk6ME)<br>
As I explained, Concurrency is the execution of multiple instances at the same time. Parallelism is the act of running multiple computations simultaneously. Although the two terms are similar, in essence, Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once, while Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once. The video does a good job explaining the two concepts and why they're different, and includes examples and comparison charts too.

3. [Thread](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_multi_threading.htm)<br>
On the Concurrency point, I mentioned that several process threads are running in parallel. A thread is basically a flow that dictates how execution of instructions are done through the process code. It also has its own Program Counter to keep track on which instruction to execute, system registers to hold the current working variables, and it also has a stack that dictates execution history. The article explains Threads in much better detail and also shows some diagram to help explain it.

4. [Thread vs Process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3EyzlZxx3g)<br>
Although a thread could some times be called a "lightweight process", there are numerous differences. Each thread also belongs to exactly one process and no thread can exist outside of a process. The biggest difference is that process is heavy weight, while thread is light weight. The video explains their differences in compact detail, and also includes some interesting analogy to make things easier.

5. [Why Thread Is Better Than Process](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/617787/why-should-i-use-a-thread-vs-using-a-process)<br>
After looking at the differences between Thread and Process, I thought to myself which is better? Then I stumbled upon a similar question in stackoverflow, but the question asks why Thread is better. Hence why I provide it here. There are multiple answers to the question, and to me all the answers seem valid.

6. [Process Mapping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPcsNmpMP70)<br>
A process map is tool that could visually describe the flow of work. It's usually presented in a flowchart, process flowchart, process chart, functional process chart, functional flowchart, process model, workflow diagram, business flow diagram or process flow diagram. It shows who and what is involved in a process and can be used in any business or organization. It can also reveal areas where a process should be improved. The article gives some visual examples to help explain what it is.

7. [Process States](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-process-states)<br>
As with many things, Processes in Operating Systems also have States, several even. The several States are New, Ready, Run, Block/Wait, Termination/Completion, Suspend Ready, and Suspend Wait/Suspend Block. The article provides an explanation to each State and a helpful diagram to tell how the states change.

8. [Process Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/process-scheduling.html)<br>
Process Scheduling is the activity of the process manager that handles the removal of the running process from the CPU and the selection of another process on the basis of a particular strategy. It's an essential activity as it allows more than one process to be loaded into the executable memory at a time and the loaded process shares the CPU using time multiplexing. As like with most articles I put here, it has diagrams to make everything easier to understand.

9. [Inter-Process Communication (IPC)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJuYKfR8vec)<br>
Inter-process communication (IPC) is a mechanism that allows processes to communicate with each other and synchronize their actions. The communication between these processes can be seen as a method of co-operation between them. Nesoacademy explains the term in great details.

10. [Multithreading Models](https://binaryterms.com/multithreading-models-in-operating-system.html)<br>
There are three Multithreading Models in Operating Systems. Many to One, One to One, and Many to Many. The article also explains more about Multithreading and its processes.
